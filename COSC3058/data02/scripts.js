        name: "Programming Bootcamp 1",
        year: 1,
        description: "Programming Bootcamp 1 introduces programming in a bootcamp style. This course covers algorithmic development using standard control structures, fundamental concepts of programming and the creation of small to medium practical applications. In this course, you will learn the basic skills of program development by working on the production of small amounts of software (typically in Java programming language). This will include skills in testing and debugging programs, and in the use of appropriate software technologies. "

        name: "Software Engineering Fundamentals for IT",
        year: 2,
        description: "This course is designed to provide you opportunity to gain knowledge and skills necessary to analyse, design and implement complex software engineering projects. You should learn to analyse and design fairly complex real-life systems, working as teams. The project based approach used requires you to review and refine your design iteratively based on regular feedback from staff. You are also made aware of current software engineering standards and processes. You are also taught to consider qualitative aspects including maintainability, extensibility, reusability and robustness in every stage of the software-engineering life-cycle. At the end of the course you should be able to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to software design and choose the most appropriate process considering the underlying technology, project duration, the level of risks and the customer expectations."
